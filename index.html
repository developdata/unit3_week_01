    Phsycial computing
    <notes>Hi, I’m Indira and I’m one of the people working with you in Unit 3. In this unit you will be exploring physical computing. In physical computing you program physical objects that interact with the physical or digital world.</notes>

    <notes>I first got into physical computing in 2015 when my first project in a new job was working on a piece for an exhibition called Big Bang Data, about how data effects our lives. Our team lead decided our piece would let people think about data models, they would be the mayor of London and from a series of decisions they made, they would be told how well they did. Instead of this being completely digital the team lead decided it should have a physical interface people interacted with, with the results shown digitally. .</notes>

    <notes>After the project I bought the Arduino starter kit and during a week off work, with a friend went through the book, and from there I developed my interest in mixing the physical with the digital. </notes>

    <h1>Aims</h1>
     <ul>
      <li>coding and creating physical computing projects</li>
      <li>using data and user inputs</li>
      <li>setting up coding environments</li>
      <li>Understanding user needs</li>
      <li>Making</li>
      <li>Transfer skills</li>

    </ul>
    <notes>The aim of this unit is to get you comfortable coding and creating physical computing projects, using data and user inputs to create interactions, setting up the coding environments you need for your projects as well as looking how people might interact with your project, understand what making is, its history and being able to transfer these skills to different physical computing technologies. Through this unit we will mainly be exploring play as means to do this.  </notes>
